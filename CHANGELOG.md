## [1.0.2] - 2021-08-17

### Fixed

- Sleepr API increments the week value during preseason which created bugs in the homepage, rankings, managers, and matchup pages
    - Added a fix to only honor the Sleeper week during regular season
- Transactions were sometimes out of order (if a trade was recently accepted long after the original offer was sent)
    - League Page now sorts the transaction by update time
